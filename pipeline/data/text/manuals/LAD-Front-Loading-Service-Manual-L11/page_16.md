# 5. MALFUNCTION CODES AND EXPLANATIONS

## E12
- **Define:** The water level in drum exceed a certain level for alarm.
- **Reasons:** When the program is in the state of suspension, operation or recoverable alarm, if the water level is detected to be higher than the overflow water level within 16 consecutive seconds, the water level will be emptied. After the empty, the E12 alarm will be given.
