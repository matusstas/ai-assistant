### Check Procedure:

### Step 5
**Check the inner wire between PCB and the water level sensor, well or not**

1. Finding terminals between PCB and the water level sensor (Fig.14–Fig.15).
2. Measuring two vertical terminals that have the same color; the resistance value indicates that the circuit is well (Fig.16).
3. If the resistance has no value, we need to replace the inner wire.
