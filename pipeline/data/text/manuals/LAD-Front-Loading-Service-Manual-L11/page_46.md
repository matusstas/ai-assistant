| E64              | (Only BLDC model have this error code) Poor communication between main PCB board and motor inverter PCB (abnormal signal transmission) | Harness in connecting wire and motor is not installed in place, or harness in connecting wire and main PCB is not installed in place |
|                  |                                                                                                     | The motor inverter PCB is damaged (the components are damaged)                                           |
|                  |                                                                                                     | Defective main PCB                                                                                       |
