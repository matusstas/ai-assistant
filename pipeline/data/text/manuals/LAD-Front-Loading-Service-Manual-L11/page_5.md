|----------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| After repair, measure insulation resistance between the charging part (power cord plug) and the non-charging metallic part (ground) with an insulation resistance meter (500V). The resistance shall be 10M or more. Failing to check the insulation resistance may cause a short circuit, electric shock or other diseases to the customer. | Do not modify the product. An electric shock or ignition may occur. | Only a repair technician can disassemble and repair. An electric shock, ignition or malfunction may cause injury. | Use an exclusive 110 VAC/15 A socket for the washing machine. Use an exclusive 220VAC/17A socket for the washing machine.
