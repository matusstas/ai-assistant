## E21
### Check Procedure:

#### Step 4: Check the drain pump
1. Lean the wash machine and remove the connector. (Fig.8)
2. Measure the resistance value of the drain pump, 150-250Ω is OK. (Fig.9)
3. If the resistance value of the drain pump is not well, change the drain pump.

#### Step 5: Check the water level sensor
1. Close the tap and disassemble the 2 screws of the top cover plate. (Fig.10)
2. Push back the top cover plate 15mm until it leaves away from the control panel and then take it down. (Fig.11)
3. Measure the resistance value of the water level sensor, 10-50Ω is OK. (Fig.12)
4. If the resistance value of the water level sensor is not well, change the water level sensor. (Fig.13)
