| **DO NOT TOUCH**         | Do not touch the laundry before the spin basket stops completely. The laundry entangles your hand causing an injury even if the basket rotates slowly. Pay special attention to children. |
| **INSTALL CAREFULLY**    | Ask an electric workshop to install the product. Install the product securely and safely according to the electrical equipment technical standard and the wiring standard. Incorrect work causes an electric shock and a fire. |
| **DO NOT PULL**         | Do not pull the power cord when unplugging. Hold the power plug to unplug. An electric shock or short circuit may cause a fire. |
| **DANGER HAND**         | Do not insert your hand under the washing machine during operation. There is a rotary part under the machine which may cause an injury. |
| **WATER LEAKAGE**       | Before starting washing, open the faucet and check the water supply hose joint which shall not be loosened for no water leaks. The loose screw or hose joint may cause water leakage resulting in unexpected damage. |
