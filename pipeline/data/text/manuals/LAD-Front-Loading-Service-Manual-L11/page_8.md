## 3 WIRING DIAGRAM/PCB LAYOUT

3.1 During the failure diagnosing and changing components, please do it as following:

1) There is some static harm to the electrical parts from colophony in the washing machine or humans. So it is better to eliminate the potential static by grounding the humans or touching the plugs.

2) The rated voltage of the SCR in PCB is 220-240V, So it's possible to be electrical shock. Please take care while strong and weak electricity is alternative.

3) The design of PCB is out of failure, so prohibit to change the PCB panel according to its alarm. Please do it according to the failure diagnose program.
