# 5. MALFUNCTION CODES AND EXPLANATIONS

## E33
- **Define:** Water level sensor problem during wash cycle.
- **Reasons:** If the washing machine detects that the frequency of the water level sensor is not within the normal range for 10 seconds, it will give an alarm.

| E33              | If the washing machine detects that the frequency of the water level sensor is not within the normal range for 10 seconds, it will give an alarm. | The wire connector loose between water level sensor and internal wire terminal  |
|                  |                                                                             | Water level sensor failure                                    |
|                  |                                                                             | The wire connector loose between PCB terminal and internal wire terminal |

## Check Procedure:
Whether the connector is loosen between water level sensor and internal wire terminal?
- **Yes**: It’s recommended that user need to confirm the connector is fixed.
- **No**: 

Whether the water level sensor itself is damaged?
- **Yes**: It’s recommended that the user need to repair or change the water level sensor.
- **No**: 

Whether the connector is loosen between PCB terminal and internal wire terminal?
- **Yes**: It’s recommended that user need to confirm the connector is fixed.
- **No**: 

Check the wire connector and harness before replacing PCB.
