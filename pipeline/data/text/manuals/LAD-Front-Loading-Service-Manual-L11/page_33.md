> Check Procedure:

### Step 1
Check whether the voltage used by the machine is reasonable:
1. For the model with the voltage of 220V~240V on the rating label, check whether the voltage used by the machine is less than 165V or more than 275V.
2. For the model with the voltage of 110V~127V on the rating label, check whether the voltage used by the machine is less than 83V or more than 158V.

① Use a multimeter to measure the voltage of the socket (Fig.1)  
② 1) For the model with the voltage of 220V~240V on the rating label, check whether the voltage used by the machine is less than 165V or more than 275V.  
2) For the model with the voltage of 110V~127V on the rating label, check whether the voltage used by the machine is less than 83V or more than 158V.
