# DIAGNOSTICS AND TROUBLESHOOTING (CONT.)

## For Service Technician Use Only

### Tachometer Verification Mode
To access Tachometer Verification Mode, perform steps 1 and 2 of Activating the Service Diagnostic Modes. Toggle the cycle selector knob until the status LEDs correspond as follows:  
- **“SOAK/WASH and DONE” LEDs On**

| POWER | SOAK/WASH | RINSE | FINAL SPIN | DONE |
|-------|-----------|-------|------------|------|

**NOTE:** Status LED names may vary between makes and models.

Press the START button to begin tachometer verification mode.  
- Tachometer verification uses the status LEDs to represent the tachometer frequency (basket RPM).
- For example, slowly turn the basket by hand; as the basket turns, the DONE, FINAL SPIN, RINSE, and SOAK/WASH status LEDs will illuminate one at a time in a visually repeating cycle. The LED timing is derived from the tachometer signal itself.
- Press and hold the START button for 3 seconds at any time to exit Tachometer Verification Mode.

### Dry Factory Diagnostics
This cycle is used by the factory to gather data for setting the proper operating parameters. This cycle is the same for all washers and may indicate that some switches or valves are actuated that are not used. Toggle the cycle selector knob until status LEDs correspond as follows:

| POWER | SOAK/WASH | RINSE | FINAL SPIN | DONE |
|-------|-----------|-------|------------|------|

**NOTE:** This cycle should not be used as a field diagnostic test.  
- While running the Dry Factory cycle, the control is also enabling the UI Diagnostics test.

### Factory Calibration Test
This cycle is used by the factory to test functions and intervals specifically for functionality testing of specific components and gathering data. Toggle the cycle selector knob until status LEDs correspond as follows:

| POWER | SOAK/WASH | RINSE | FINAL SPIN | DONE |
|-------|-----------|-------|------------|------|

**NOTE:** This cycle should not be used as a field diagnostic test.
