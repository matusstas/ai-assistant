## GENERAL INFORMATION (CONT.)

### Shifter/Actuator
The actuator serves several functions. It has a synchronous motor that shifts the splutch slider and monitors the position of the splutch. It also houses a transmission speed/position optical sensor.

The shifter motor rotates a cam, attached to the shifter arm which moves between two positions. The shifter arm moves the transmission lever which engages or disengages the transmission creating agitate and spin. The washing machine is in spin when the shifter is up in this position. The teeth of the splutch are engaged with the teeth of the pulley and the motor turns the pulley in a direction for spin. When the shifter pulls the lever down it disengages the teeth. The washing machine is in agitate. The length of each stroke is controlled by the CCU. There are three different patterns.

### Lid Lock
Since this washer does not utilize a brake, a lid lock is used to prevent access during spin. During the spin cycles, a lid lock mechanism will lock the lid. The lid must be closed for the washer to fill, wash, drain, or spin. The lock mechanism houses a switch that senses the lid is down, a latch solenoid and a magnetic reed switch to confirm that the lid is locked.
