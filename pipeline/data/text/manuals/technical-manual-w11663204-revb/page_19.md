# DIAGNOSTICS AND TROUBLESHOOTING (CONT.)

## For Service Technician Use Only

### Fault/Error Code Display Method
Fault/error codes are displayed by altering the state of the Status LEDs in one second intervals. All fault/error codes have an F# and an E#. The F# indicates the suspect System/Category and the E# indicates the suspect Component system.  
If the POWER LED is ON, the Fault Number is represented; if OFF, the Error Number is represented (see example below). The remaining LEDs (SOAK/WASH, RINSE, FINAL SPIN, and DONE) represent the fault and error code in binary. (See Fault/Error Code Charts for more information.)

| Frame Number | Status LEDs              | Status LEDs              | Error Code |
|--------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|------------|
|              | POWER  SOAK/WASH        | RINSE   FINAL SPIN      |            |
| 1            | F 8  4  2 1  F2        |                          | = ON       |
| 2            | E 8  4  2 1  E3        |                          |            |
| 3            |                          |                          |            |
| 4            |                          |                          |            |

**LED names may vary between makes and models.**

### Quick Overview Test Mode
To access Quick Overview Test Mode, perform steps 1 and 2 of Activating the Service Diagnostic Test Modes. Toggle the cycle selector knob until the status LEDs correspond as follows:

- **“FINAL SPIN” LED On**

**NOTE:** Status LED names may vary between makes and models.  
Press the START button to begin the Quick Overview Test. Check the Quick Overview Test Mode for more information on tests.

- Upon entering the Quick Overview Test Mode, the washer will perform an automatic test with water cycles to check major washer functions.
- Pressing the START button will manually advance to the next step.
- Press and hold the START button for 3 seconds at any time to exit any test mode.

**IMPORTANT:** Lid must be closed with lid lock enabled to perform test.

### Manual Overview Test Mode
To access Manual Overview Test Mode, perform steps 1 and 2 of Activating the Service Diagnostic Test Modes. Toggle the cycle selector knob until the status LEDs correspond as follows:

- **“FINAL SPIN and DONE” LEDs On**

| POWER | SOAK/WASH | RINSE | FINAL SPIN | DONE |
|-------|-----------|-------|------------|------|

Press the START button to enter Manual Overview Test mode.

- Upon entering the Manual Overview test mode, the washer will have all outputs OFF.
- The cycle selector knob is used to select the output to be tested.
- The START button will activate/deactivate the selected output.
- When the selected output is activated, the corresponding status LEDs flash ON and OFF.
- Press and hold the START button for 3 seconds at any time to exit any test mode.

**IMPORTANT:** As a safety feature, the lid must be closed with lid lock enabled to activate either Agitate or Spin Test.  
NOTE: Multiple outputs may be activated simultaneously. Outputs left on will time-out after 5 minutes.

### Calibration Mode
**IMPORTANT:** Calibration must be performed when any of the following components have been replaced: Main Control, Basket, Drive Assembly, Suspension, Motor, and Capacitor. Calibration should also be performed when the washer is moved to a different location or, more specifically, to a different power outlet. Not performing calibration may result in poor wash performance.

To access Calibration Mode, perform steps 1 and 2 of Activating the Service Diagnostic Test Modes. Toggle the cycle selector knob until the status LEDs correspond as follows:

- **“RINSE” LED On**

| POWER | SOAK/WASH | RINSE | FINAL SPIN | DONE |
|-------|-----------|-------|------------|------|

**NOTE:** Status LED names may vary between makes and models.  
Press the START button to begin washer calibration. All status LEDs will turn on.

- DO NOT interrupt calibration, disturb washer, or remove power; otherwise, calibration must be repeated.
- Lid must be down to perform test.
- Basket must be empty to perform test (no water or clothes).
- Calibration cycle runs for approximately 2–4 minutes. Cycle completes when door unlocks and washer enters standby mode.
