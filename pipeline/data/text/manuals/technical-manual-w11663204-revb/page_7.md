# General Theory of Operation

## Introduction
The Maytag® 3.5 cu ft Commercial-Grade Residential Agitator Washer has several familiar features and some new designs integrating them into this totally new design.

## Drive System
**Motor**  
Bi-directional PSC (Permanent Split Capacitor) 120 VAC. Agitation and variable spin speeds are accomplished by applying power in pulses.

**Transmission**  
The transmission is a non-serviceable belt driven component.  
- Inner shaft top splines connect to the agitator.  
- Bottom splines connect to the splutch pulley.  
- Bottom splines connect to the inner splines of the splutch cam.  

## Splutch
The splutch is made up of five parts:  
- Spring  
- Housing  
- Cam Ring  
- Basket Drive Gear and Pulley  

The pulley is connected to the agitator through the agitator shaft. The agitator always moves with the pulley. The basket drive gear is connected to the basket by the inner splines contacting the outer splines of the transmission. The cam ring raises and lowers the basket drive gear. When the basket drive gear teeth are engaged to the pulley teeth the basket will spin along with the agipellor.
