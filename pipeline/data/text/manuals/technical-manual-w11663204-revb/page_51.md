10. Pry the three (3) spring clips out to release the wire harness from the right edge of the top.

11. Remove two (2) 1/4" hex head screws securing lid lock to underside of top. These screws have a shoulder and rubber O-ring.

**TECH TIP:** When reinstalling these screws, tighten until snug, then loosen 1/4 turn. Do not overtighten these screws. The bezel and lock assembly must be able to move slightly so latch can be properly positioned every time lid is opened and closed.

12. The lid lock is replaced as one component.

13. Lower the top panel of the washer and open the lid.

14. Remove bezel on the washer top, under the lid. The bezel has posts that protrude down through holes in the lid lock assembly.

15. When reinstalling the bezel, the locking edge with the bevel should be toward the front. The lock symbol will be toward the center of the washing machine.

**NOTE:** Make sure the O-rings are present when securing the lid lock assembly.

**TECH TIP:** When reinstalling bezel, tape bezel in place to help with the reinstallation of the screws from under the washer top.

16. After selecting a cycle and pressing the Start button, the lid will lock only during the spin portion of the cycles.
