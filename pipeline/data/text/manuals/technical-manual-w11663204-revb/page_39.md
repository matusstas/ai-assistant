# COMPONENT TESTING (CONT.)

![Figure - Drain Pump Strip Circuit](attachment://Drain_Pump_Strip_Circuit.png)

7. Tilt washer back to access drain pump. Verify pump is free from obstructions.  
8. Visually check the electrical connections at the drain pump.  
   - If visual check passes, go to step 9.  
   - If connections are loose, reconnect the electrical connections and repeat step 2.  

9. With an ohmmeter, check harness for continuity between the drain pump and main control. See chart below.

**Main Control to Drain Pump**  
| Connection              | Pin          |
|------------------------|--------------|
| Drain Pump Pin 1 to Main Control J16-3 |   |
| Drain Pump Pin 2 to Main Control J16-2 |   |
| If there is continuity, go to step 10.  |   |
| If there is no continuity, replace the lower machine harness and repeat step 2. |   |

10. With an ohmmeter, measure the resistance across the two pump terminals. Resistance should be 14–25 Ω.  
    - If values are open or out of range, replace the pump motor.  
    - If the resistance at the pump motor is correct, go to step 11.  

11. If the preceding steps did not correct the drain problem, replace the main control.  
    a. Unplug washer or disconnect power.  
    b. Replace the main control.  
    c. Reassemble all parts and panels.  
    d. Plug in washer or reconnect power. Calibrate washer and perform Quick Overview Test to verify repair.  

## TEST #8: Lid Lock
Perform the following checks if the washer does not lock (or unlock).  
1. Perform the Lid Lock test under Manual Overview Test Mode.  
   The following steps assume that this test was unsuccessful.  
2. Check lid lock mechanism for obstruction or binding. Repair as necessary.  
3. Unplug washer or disconnect power.  
4. Remove console to access main control.  
5. Visually check that the J15 connector is inserted all the way into the main control.  
   - If visual check passes, go to step 6.  
   - If connector is not inserted properly, reconnect J15 and repeat step 1.  

6. Remove connector J15 from main control. With an ohmmeter, verify lid lock resistance values shown below across the following J15 connector pinouts:  
   - If switch measurements do not match the values shown in the table for unlocked (or locked) condition, a problem exists in the lid lock mechanism.  

**LID LOCK RESISTANCE**  
| Component              | Resistance     | Contacts Measured  |
|-----------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Lock Switch Solenoid   | 85 to 155 Ω    | J15-1  J15-3        |
| Lock Switch            | Locked = 0 Ω   | J15-3  J15-4        |
| Lid Switch             | Lid Closed = 0 Ω | J15-3  J15-2       |
|                        | Lid Open = Open Circuit |               |

7. If the preceding steps did not correct the lock problem, replace the main control.  
    a. Unplug washer or disconnect power.  
    b. Replace the main control.  
    c. Reassemble all parts and panels.  
    d. Plug in washer or reconnect power. Calibrate washer and perform Quick Overview Test to verify repair.
