| **Explanation and Recommended Procedure**                                                                           |              |              |
| (Status LED names may vary between makes and models)                                                                |              |              |
| **F5E1 – LID SWITCH FAULT**                                                                                         | F 4 1 E 1    |              |
| Fault is displayed if lid is in locked state, but lid switch is open.                                             |              |              |
| - User presses START with lid open.                                                                                 |              |              |
| - The main control cannot detect the lid switch opening and closing properly.                                       |              |              |
| - See **TEST #8: Lid Lock**.                                                                                        |              |              |
| **F5E2 – LID LOCK FAULT**                                                                                           | F 4 1 E 2    |              |
| Fault is displayed if Lid Lock has not moved into locked position or motor cannot be powered.                      |              |              |
| - Lid is not closed completely due to interference.                                                                 |              |              |
| - Check for lock interference with lock striker.                                                                    |              |              |
| - Wash media buildup (detergent, lint, etc.) is preventing the lock mechanism from sliding.                        |              |              |
| - Main control detects open lid switch when attempting to lock.                                                     |              |              |
| - Main control cannot determine if lid lock is in a locked state.                                                  |              |              |
| - See **TEST #8: Lid Lock**.                                                                                        |              |              |
| **F5E3 – LID UNLOCK FAULT**                                                                                         | F 8 4 2 1 E 8 4 2 1 |              |
| Fault is displayed if Lid Lock has not moved into unlocked position or motor cannot be powered.                    |              |              |
| - Check for lock interference with lock striker.                                                                    |              |              |
| - Main control cannot determine if lid lock is in an unlocked state.                                               |              |              |
| - See **TEST #8: Lid Lock**.                                                                                        |              |              |
| **F5E4 – LID NOT OPENED BETWEEN CYCLES**                                                                            | F 4 1 E 4    |              |
| Fault is displayed if the following conditions occur:                                                              |              |              |
| - User presses START after several consecutive washer cycles without opening lid.                                   |              |              |
| - See **TEST #8: Lid Lock**.                                                                                        |              |              |
| **F7E1 – BASKET SPEED SENSOR FAULT**                                                                                | F 4 2 1 E 1  |              |
| Fault is displayed when the main control cannot determine speed of basket, or speed changes too quickly.           |              |              |
