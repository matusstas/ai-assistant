## For Service Technician Use Only

| Fault/Error Code – Description | Fault Number | Error Number | Status LEDs | Status LEDs |
|--------------------------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Explanation and Recommended Procedure** |              |              | **PO WER**   | **SOAK/WASH**  | **RINSE** | **FINAL SPIN** | **DONE** |
| **F727 – MOTOR UNABLE TO REACH TARGET RPM** | F | 4 | 2 | E | 4 | 2 | 1 |
| Fault is displayed when basket speed sensor detects that target RPM was not reached.  |
| - Mechanical friction on drive mechanism or basket (clothing between basket and tub).  |
| - Weak motor or run capacitor, or no connection to run capacitor.  |
| - Load of balance. Clothing should be distributed evenly when loading.  |
| - See TEST #3b: Drive System – Motor.  |

| **F801 – LONG FILL** | F | 8 | E | 1 |
| Fault is displayed when the water level does not change for a period of time OR water is present but main control does not detect the water level changing. |
| - Is water supply connected and turned on?  |
| - Low water pressure; fill times longer than 6 minutes. Are hose screens plugged?  |
| - Check for proper drain hose installation. Is water siphoning out of the drain hose?  |
| - Drain hose must not be more than 4.5" (114 mm) into the drain pipe.  |
| - Check pressure hose connection from tub to pressure sensor. Is hose pinched, kinked, plugged, or leaking air?  |
| - See TEST #2: Valves. |

| **F803 – OVERFLOW CONDITION** | F | 8 | E | 2 | 1 |
| Fault is displayed when main control senses water level that exceeds the washer’s capacity.  |
| - May signify problem with inlet water valves.  |
| - Check pressure hose connection from tub to pressure sensor. Is hose pinched, kinked, plugged, or leaking air?  |
| - Not pumping—pressure transducer closed or shorted in standby, or after washer completes a cycle.  |
| - See TEST #2: Valves and TEST #6: Water Level. |

| **F805 – HOT, COLD REVERSED** | F | 8 | E | 4 | 1 |
| Fault is displayed when the hot and cold inlet hoses are reversed.  |
| - Make sure inlet hoses are connected correctly.  |
| - If hoses are installed properly, temperature thermistor may be stuck in low resistance range.  |
| - See TEST #2: Valves and TEST #5: Temperature Thermistor. |

| **F806 – NO FILL** | F | 8 | E | 4 | 2 |
| Fault is displayed when the water level does not change for a period of time OR water is present but main control does not detect the water level changing. |
| - Is water supply connected and turned on?  |
| - Low water pressure; fill times longer than 6 minutes. Are hose screens plugged?  |
| - Check for proper drain hose installation. Is water siphoning out of the drain hose?  |
| - Drain hose must not be more than 4.5" (114 mm) into the drain pipe.  |
| - Check pressure hose connection from tub to pressure sensor. Is hose pinched, kinked, plugged, or leaking air?  |
| - See TEST #2: Valves. |

**NOTE:** If the POWER LED is ON, the fault code is represented; if OFF, the error code is represented.
