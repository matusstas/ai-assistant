| Fault/Error Code – Description                     | Fault Number | Error Number |
|---------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|
|                                                   |              |              |
| **Explanation and Recommended Procedure**         |              |              |
| (Status LED names may vary between makes and models) |              |              |
| **PO W ER**                                       | **SOAK/WASH**| **RINSE**    | **FINAL SPIN** | **DONE**      |
| **F0E0 – NO FAULT**                               | ON           | 8            | 4            | 2            | OFF          | 8            | 4            | 2            | 1            |
| **F0E2 – OVER SUDS CONDITION DETECTED**          | F            | E            | 2            |
| Fault is displayed when Suds prevent the basket from spinning up to speed or the pressure sensor detects rising suds level. The main control will flush water in attempt to clear Suds. If the water flush is unable to correct the problem, this may indicate: |
| - Not using HE detergent.                          |
| - Excessive detergent usage.                       |
| - Check pressure hose connection from tub to pressure sensor. Is hose pinched, kinked, plugged, or leaking air? |
| - Mechanical friction on drive mechanism or basket. (Clothing between basket and tub.) |
| **F0E4 – HIGH WATER TEMPERATURE – RINSE CYCLE**  | F            | E            | 4            |
| Hot water getting in. Make sure inlet hoses are connected correctly. |
| If hoses are installed properly, temperature thermistor may be stuck in low resistance range. |
| **See TEST #5: Temperature Thermistor.**         |
| **F0E5 – OFF BALANCE LOAD DETECTED**              | F            | E            | 4            | 1            |
| Fault is displayed when an off balance condition is detected. |
| - Check for weak suspension. Basket should not bounce up and down more than once when pushed. |
| - Clothing should be distributed evenly when loading. |
| **F1E1 – MAIN CONTROL FAULT**                      | F            | 1            | E            | 1            |
| Indicates a main control fault.                     |
| **See TEST #1: Main Control.**                    |
| **F1E2 – MOTOR CONTROL FAULT**                     | F            | 1            | E            | 2            |
| Indicates a fault of the motor control section of the main control. |
| **See TEST #3b: Drive System – Motor.**          |
| **F2E1 – STUCK KEY**                              | F            | 2            | E            | 1            |
| The START key has been actuated for 10 consecutive minutes. |
| Fault occurs during Diagnostic Test Mode if a stuck key is detected. |
| **See TEST #4: Console and Indicators.**          |
| **F2E3 – MISMATCH OF MAIN CONTROL AND UI**        | F            | 2            | E            | 2            | 1            |
| The User Interface identification does not match the expected value in the Main Control Board. |
| Fault occurs during Diagnostic Test Mode if a mismatch of main control and UI is identified. |
| **See TEST #4: Console and Indicators.**          |
| **F3E1 – PRESSURE SENSOR FAULT**                  | F            | 2            | 1            | E            | 1            |
| Fault is displayed when the Main Control detects an out of range pressure signal. |
| - Check pressure hose connection from tub to pressure sensor. Is hose pinched, kinked, plugged, or leaking air? |
| **See TEST #6: Water Level.**                     |
| **F3E2 – INLET WATER TEMPERATURE FAULT**          | F            | 2            | 1            | E            | 2            |
| Fault is displayed when the Inlet Thermistor is detected to be open or shorted. |
| **See TEST #5: Temperature Thermistor.**         |

NOTE: If the POWER LED is ON, the fault code is represented; if OFF, the error code is represented.
