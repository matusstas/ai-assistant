# DIAGNOSTICS AND TROUBLESHOOTING (CONT.)

## For Service Technician Use Only

### Diagnostic Guide

Before Servicing, check the following:
- Make sure there is power at the wall outlet.
- Has a household fuse blown or circuit breaker tripped? Was a regular fuse used? Inform customer that a time-delay fuse is required.
- Are both hot and cold water faucets open and water supply hoses unobstructed?
- Make sure drain hose is not sealed into drain pipe, and that there is an air gap for ventilation. Ensure drain height is between 39" (0.991 m) and 8' (2.44 m) above the floor.
  
All tests/checks should be made with a VOM (volt-ohm-milliammeter) or DVM (digital-voltmeter) having a sensitivity of 20,000 Ω per volt DC or greater.

- Resistance checks must be made with washer unplugged or power disconnected.  
  **IMPORTANT:** Avoid using large diameter probes when checking harness connectors as the probes may damage the connectors upon insertion.

- Check all harnesses and connections before replacing components. Look for connectors not fully seated, broken or loose wires and terminals, or wires not pressed into connectors far enough to engage metal bars.

- A potential cause of a control not functioning is corrosion or contamination on connectors. Use an ohmmeter to check for continuity across suspected connections.

### Diagnostic LED – Main Control

A troubleshooting tool has been implemented onto the main control board—a diagnostic LED.

- **LED ON** – The Control is detecting correct incoming line voltage and the processor is functioning.  
- **LED OFF** – No power to control or control malfunction. Perform TEST #1: Main Control, to verify main control functionality.

### Failure Mode

If the incoming water supply is restricted or off, the cycle will end and the following 3 LEDs will be lit. Opening and closing the lid will reset the control to the beginning of a new cycle. The incoming water supply needs to be corrected prior to starting the next cycle or the risk of another cancelled cycle is high.
- **“POWER, RINSE, and DONE” LEDs On**

All 5 LEDs lit and not flashing indicates that the washer is out of service. Enter the Service Diagnostic Test Modes and then enter Fault Code Display Mode to determine the mode of failure and to reset the control.
- **All 5 LEDs On and Not Flashing**

### Service Diagnostic Test Modes

These tests allow factory or service personnel to test and verify all inputs to the main control board. Utilize these performance tests before continuing to specific component troubleshooting tests.

#### Activating the Service Diagnostic Test Modes
1. Be sure the washer is in standby mode (plugged in with all indicators off).
2. Perform the following sequence of movement using the cycle selector knob.

   **NOTE:** After RESET, sequence “a” through “e” must be completed within 6 seconds, stopping just briefly between each click (resulting in the following sequence: Left - Right - Left - Right - Left, as indicated below).

   **RESET:** Place cycle selector knob pointer at 12 o’clock position and wait 3–4 seconds before proceeding.

   a. Rotate cycle selector knob counterclockwise one click.

   b. Rotate cycle selector knob clockwise one click.

   c. Rotate cycle selector knob clockwise one click.

   d. Rotate cycle selector knob counterclockwise one click.

   e. Rotate cycle selector knob clockwise one click.
