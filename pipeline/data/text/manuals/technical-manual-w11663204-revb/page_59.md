**NOTE:** The shifter motor rotates a cam, attached to the shifter arm which moves between two positions. The shifter arm moves the transmission lever which engages or disengages the transmission creating agitate and spin. The washing machine is in spin when the shifter is up in this position. The teeth of the splutch are engaged with the teeth of the pulley and the motor turns the pulley in a direction for spin. When the shifter pulls the lever down it disengages the teeth. The washing machine is in agitate. The length of each stroke is controlled by the CCU. There are three different patterns.
