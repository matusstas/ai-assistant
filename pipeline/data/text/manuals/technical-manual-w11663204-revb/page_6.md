## Safety

Your safety and the safety of others are very important.

We have provided many important safety messages in this manual and on your appliance. Always read and obey all safety messages.

This is the safety alert symbol.  
This symbol alerts you to potential hazards that can kill or hurt you and others.  
All safety messages will follow the safety alert symbol and either the word “DANGER” or “WARNING.”  
These words mean:

- **DANGER**  
  You can be killed or seriously injured if you don't immediately follow instructions.

- **WARNING**  
  You can be killed or seriously injured if you don't follow instructions.

All safety messages will tell you what the potential hazard is, tell you how to reduce the chance of injury, and tell you what can happen if the instructions are not followed.

### IMPORTANT SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS

**WARNING:** To reduce the risk of fire, electric shock, or injury to persons when using the washer, follow basic precautions, including the following:

- Read all instructions before using the washer.
- Do not wash articles that have been previously cleaned in, washed in, soaked in, or spotted with gasoline, dry-cleaning solvents, other flammable, or explosive substances as they give off vapors that could ignite or explode.
- Do not add gasoline, dry-cleaning solvents, or other flammable, or explosive substances to the wash water. These substances give off vapors that could ignite or explode.
- Under certain conditions, hydrogen gas may be produced in a hot water system that has not been used for 2 weeks or more. **HYDROGEN GAS IS EXPLOSIVE.** If the hot water system has not been used for such a period, before using the washing machine, turn on all hot water faucets and let the water flow from each for several minutes. This will release any accumulated hydrogen gas. As the gas is flammable, do not smoke or use an open flame during this time.

- Do not allow children to play on or in the washer. Close supervision of children is necessary when the washer is used near children.
- Before the washer is removed from service or discarded, remove the door or lid.
- Do not reach into the washer if the drum, tub or agitator is moving.
- Do not install or store the washer where it will be exposed to the weather.
- Do not tamper with controls.
- Do not repair or replace any part of the washer or attempt any servicing unless specifically recommended in this manual or in published user-repair instructions that you understand and have the skills to carry out.
- See Installation Instructions for grounding instructions.
- **WARNING:** Do not wash water-resistant or water-repellent-type clothing. Failure to closely follow these instructions may result in an abnormal vibrating and out-of-balance condition that could result in physical injury, property damage, and/or appliance damage.
