# Product Features

## Control Panel

1. **WASH CYCLE KNOB**  
   Use the Wash Cycle knob to select cycles on your washer. Knob does not advance during the progress of the cycle – see cycle status lights for each stage of the process. See “Cycle Guide” for detailed descriptions of cycles.  
   Select the cycle most suitable for your load. Items need to move freely. Tightly packing can lead to poor cleaning performance and may increase wrinkling and tangling.

2. **TEMPERATURE**  
   Temperature senses and maintains uniform water temperatures by regulating incoming hot and cold water.  
   Select a wash temperature based on the type of fabric and soil being handled. For best results, and following the garment label instructions, use the warmest wash water safe for your fabric.  
   - Normal, Warm, and Hot water may be cooler than your previous washer. Deep Water cycles will provide higher temperatures for the wash cycle.  
   Even in a cold or cool water wash, some warm water may be added to the washer to maintain a minimum temperature.

3. **OPTIONS**  
   You may add or remove options for each cycle. Not all options can be used with all cycles, and some are preset to work with certain cycles.  
   - **EXTRA RINSE**  
     This option can be used to automatically add a second rinse to most cycles.  
   - **PRESOAK & EXTRA RINSE**  
     Use this option to add both an extra soak period to any cycle and a second rinse to most cycles.  
   - **PRESOAK**  
     Use this option to add an extra soak period to any cycle to help loosen tough stains. The washer will agitate briefly, fill and pause to soak, then begin the selected cycle.

4. **POWER/START/PAUSE BUTTON**  
   Press to start the selected cycle. To unlock the lid during Final Spin, press to pause the cycle. Press and hold for 3 seconds to cancel a cycle.  
   **NOTE:** If the washer is spinning, it may take several minutes to unlock the lid.

5. **CYCLE STATUS LIGHTS INDICATOR**  
   The Cycle Status lights show the progress of a cycle. At each stage of the process, you may notice sounds or pauses that are different from traditional washers.  
   - **POWER**  
     This LED will turn on when a new cycle is selected or the POWER/START/PAUSE button is pressed the first time and will remain on throughout the cycle.  
   - **SOAK/WASH**  
     This LED remains illuminated during the Soak/Wash portion of the cycle.  
   - **RINSE**  
     This LED remains illuminated during the Rinse portion of the cycle. Fabric softener can be added at this stage of the cycle.  
   - **FINAL SPIN/LID LOCKED**  
     The Final Spin LED and the Lid Locked LED will both remain illuminated during this portion of the cycle. If you need to open the lid prior to cycle completion, press and hold POWER/START/PAUSE for 3 seconds.  
   - **DONE**  
     This LED illuminates when the cycle is complete and will turn off when the lid is open.

6. **WATER LEVEL**

     The Low setting is recommended for small loads, approximately 1/3 capacity with a water level of 8 gallons.  
   - **MEDIUM**  
     The Medium setting is recommended for medium loads, approximately 1/2 capacity with a water level of 12 gallons.  
   - **HIGH**  
     The High setting is recommended for large loads, approximately 3/4 capacity with a water level of 18 gallons.
