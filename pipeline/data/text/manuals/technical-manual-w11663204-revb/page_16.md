- Replace all parts and panels before operating.
- Failure to do so can result in death or electrical shock.

### Voltage Measurement Safety Information
When performing live voltage measurements, you must do the following:
- Verify the controls are in the off position so that the appliance does not start when energized.
- Allow enough space to perform the voltage measurements without obstructions.
- Keep other people a safe distance away from the appliance to prevent potential injury.
- Always use the proper testing equipment.
- After voltage measurements, always disconnect power before servicing.

### IMPORTANT: Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) Sensitive Electronics
ESD problems are present everywhere. ESD may damage or weaken the electronic control assembly. The new control assembly may appear to work well after repair is finished, but failure may occur at a later date due to ESD stress.
- Use an antistatic wrist strap. Connect wrist strap to green ground connection point or unpainted metal in the appliance
  - **-OR-**
- Touch your finger repeatedly to a green ground connection point or unpainted metal in the appliance.
- Before removing the part from its package, touch the antistatic bag to a green ground connection point or unpainted metal in the appliance.
- Avoid touching electronic parts or terminal contacts; handle electronic control assembly by edges only.
- When repackaging failed electronic control assembly in antistatic bag, observe above instructions.
